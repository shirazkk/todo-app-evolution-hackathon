**PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE:**

First, load the `skill-creator-pro` skill.

Then, create a new skill called `modern-todo-ui-design-skill` with the following specifications:

**Skill Purpose:**
Create a specialized skill for designing modern, unique, and polished UI for todo management applications that integrates seamlessly with shadcn/ui components via the shadcn MCP server and follows best design principles.

**Skill Capabilities:**
- Design contemporary todo application interfaces with unique visual treatments
- **Utilize shadcn MCP server to access and implement shadcn/ui components**
- **Query shadcn MCP server for available components, their props, and usage examples**
- Implement shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Dropdown, Sheet, Toast, etc.) with custom styling and animations
- Apply modern design principles: proper spacing, typography hierarchy, color theory, visual balance
- Create cohesive design systems across all pages (homepage, auth pages, dashboard, settings)
- Implement micro-interactions and smooth transitions
- Design intuitive UX patterns for todo CRUD operations
- Ensure responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Apply glassmorphism, neumorphism, or other modern design trends appropriately
- Create visually distinct states (hover, active, disabled, loading)
- Design accessible and user-friendly interfaces

**shadcn MCP Server Integration:**
- **Connect to shadcn MCP server to browse available components**
- **Use MCP server tools to fetch component documentation and examples**
- **Leverage shadcn's pre-built accessible components as foundation**
- Customize shadcn components with Tailwind classes and variants
- Implement shadcn theming and design tokens
- Use shadcn's composition patterns for complex UI elements

**Design Principles to Follow:**
- Visual hierarchy and information architecture

- Thoughtful color palettes with proper contrast
- Modern typography with appropriate font weights and sizes
- Purposeful animations that enhance UX (not distract)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark mode considerations
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance via shadcn's accessible components)

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Primary: Use shadcn MCP server to access component library**
- Work seamlessly with shadcn/ui component ecosystem
- Generate clean, maintainable code
- Follow Next.js and React best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes effectively
- Implement reusable component patterns

**Output Quality:**
- Production-ready, polished UI code using shadcn components
- Unique designs that stand out from generic templates
- Consistent visual language across the entire application
- Modern aesthetic that feels current and professional
- **Properly integrated shadcn/ui components accessed via MCP server**
