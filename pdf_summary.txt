Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development - PDF Summary

Based on the extracted content from the PDF, here's what I can see:

1. Title: "Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development"
2. Subtitle: "The Evolution of Todo - Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI"
3. The document describes a hackathon project that evolves a simple todo application through 5 phases:
   - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App (Python, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus) - 100 points - Due Dec 7, 2025
   - Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application (Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB) - 150 points - Due Dec 14, 2025
   - Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot (OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK)
   - Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment (Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent)
   - Phase V: Advanced Cloud Deployment (Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS)

The project focuses on:
- Spec-driven development methodology
- Using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- Progressive evolution from simple CLI app to complex cloud-native AI system
- The document has 47 pages in total

Key concepts mentioned:
- Agentic Dev Stack (Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code)
- No manual coding allowed - everything must be generated from specs
- Building progressively complex software without writing boilerplate code
