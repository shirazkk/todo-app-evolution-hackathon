# **AGENTS.md**

## **Purpose**

This project uses **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — a workflow where **no agent is allowed to write code until the specification is complete and approved**.
All AI agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, local LLMs, etc.) must follow the **Spec-Kit lifecycle**:

> **Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement**

This prevents “vibe coding,” ensures alignment across agents, and guarantees that every implementation step maps back to an explicit requirement.

---

## **How Agents Must Work**

Every agent in this project MUST obey these rules:

1. **Never generate code without a referenced Task ID.**
2. **Never modify architecture without updating `speckit.plan`.**
3. **Never propose features without updating `speckit.specify` (WHAT).**
4. **Never change approach without updating `speckit.constitution` (Principles).**
5. **Every code file must contain a comment linking it to the Task and Spec sections.**

If an agent cannot find the required spec, it must **stop and request it**, not improvise.

## **Spec-Kit Workflow (Source of Truth)**

### **1. Constitution (WHY — Principles & Constraints)**

File: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
Defines the project’s non-negotiables: architecture values, security rules, tech stack constraints, performance expectations, and patterns allowed.

Agents must check this before proposing solutions.

---

### **2. Specify (WHAT — Requirements, Journeys & Acceptance Criteria)**

File: `/specs/`feature-name`/spec.md`

Contains:

* User journeys
* Requirements
* Acceptance criteria
* Domain rules
* Business constraints

Agents must not infer missing requirements — they must request clarification or propose specification updates.

---

### **3. Plan (HOW — Architecture, Components, Interfaces)**

File: `/specs/`feature-name`/plan.md`

Includes:

* Component breakdown
* APIs & schema diagrams
* Service boundaries
* System responsibilities
* High-level sequencing

All architectural output MUST be generated from the Specify file.

---

### **4. Tasks (BREAKDOWN — Atomic, Testable Work Units)**

File:`/specs/`feature-name`/tasks.md`

Each Task must contain:

* Task ID
* Clear description
* Preconditions
* Expected outputs
* Artifacts to modify
* Links back to Specify + Plan sections

Agents **implement only what these tasks define**.

---

### **5. Implement (CODE — Write Only What the Tasks Authorize)**

Agents now write code, but must:

* Reference Task IDs
* Follow the Plan exactly
* Not invent new features or flows
* Stop and request clarification if anything is underspecified

> The golden rule: **No task = No code.**

## **Agent Behavior in This Project**

### **When generating code:**

Agents must reference:

```
[Task]: T-001
[From]: speckit.specify §2.1, speckit.plan §3.4
```

### **When proposing architecture:**

Agents must reference:

```
Update required in speckit.plan → add component X
```

### **When proposing new behavior or a new feature:**

Agents must reference:

```
Requires update in speckit.specify (WHAT)
```

### **When changing principles:**

Agents must reference:

```
Modify constitution.md → Principle #X
```

## **Agent Failure Modes (What Agents MUST Avoid)**

Agents are NOT allowed to:

* Freestyle code or architecture
* Generate missing requirements
* Create tasks on their own
* Alter stack choices without justification
* Add endpoints, fields, or flows that aren’t in the spec
* Ignore acceptance criteria
* Produce “creative” implementations that violate the plan

If a conflict arises between spec files, the **Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks** hierarchy applies.

## **Developer–Agent Alignment**

Humans and agents collaborate, but the **spec is the single source of truth**.
Before every session, agents should re-read:

1. `.memory/constitution.md`

This ensures predictable, deterministic development.
